# Introduction to User Experience(UX) Design

This contains my learnings of UX design from Week1 of 1st course of Google UX certificate program.

**Q. When did the study of user experience (UX) begin?**
A: The phrase "User Experience" was first coined in the 1990s by the famous psychologist **Don Norman**.
But before that like 1000s of years back, UX design is being practised. As an example, how your furnitures are designed and kept in your drawing room.

Here are some helpful UX design resources to keep in mind as you learn. You might even want to bookmark some of these websites on your computer to review on an ongoing basis!

## Basics of UX Design

**Q. What is UX design?**
A: UX design is the process of designing (digital or physical) products that are useful, easy to use, and delightful to interact with. It’s about enhancing the experience that people have while interacting with your product, and making sure they find value in what you’re providing.

> User experience is "How a person, the user, feels about interacting with, or experiencing, a product"

**Q. What is a product?**
A: A product is a good service or feature. It might be a physical product like a video game controller or a bag of potato chips. It might be a digital product like a mobile app or a website. Or it might be a service like a ride-sharing app or a streaming service.
